        <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavour.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavour of the sauce.</li>

        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
