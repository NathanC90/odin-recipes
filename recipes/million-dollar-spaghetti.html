    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>reheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti. Cover with remaining spaghetti and top with remaining slices of butter.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 15 minutes more.</p>
