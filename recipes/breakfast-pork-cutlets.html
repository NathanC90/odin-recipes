    <p>
        How long has it been since a new breakfast meat was introduced to the public?
         If you like breakfast sausage, or chicken fried steak, or pork chops with your eggs,
          then you're going to love these, since they were inspired by all three.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Spice Mix:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon whole fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cutlet:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6-8-ounce) boneless center cut pork chops, trimmed</li>    
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fine dry breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Crush fennel seeds in a mortar and pestle; transfer to a small bowl. Stir in black pepper, poultry seasoning, nutmeg, garlic powder, and cayenne; set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Make several shallow vertical cuts through fat on edges of each pork chop. Place each chop between 2 pieces of plastic wrap; pound to 1/4-inch thick using a meat pounder or heavy flat object. Transfer to a plate.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Season both sides of chops with salt; sprinkle both sides with spice mix. Rub or brush each side of chops with about Â½ teaspoon maple syrup. </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle each chop on one side with breadcrumbs; press in firmly. Turn over and repeat.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil and butter in a nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Pan fry pork cutlets, turning once, until meat is no longer pink at the center and edges are browned and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>Top your pork chops with a soft-boiled egg and pickled onions if you like.</p>
