# odin-recipes

In this project, we can use the knowledge and skills we learn to create a simple recipe website.

I created a website with 5 different recipes in different pages.

All pages include the same structure (HTML Boilerplate, h1 headings, ul lists for bullet point items and ol list for numbered items).

For security safe, all anchor tags are added 'rel' attribute with 'noopener' value.

Regarding images, I set the width of most photos to '500' except for the picture on Vegan Pumpkin Pancake. Instead, I adjust the height of the pancake photo in case it causes too much scrolling.

All the recipe contents are from this webiste: https://www.allrecipes.com/
